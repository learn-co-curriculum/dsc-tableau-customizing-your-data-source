    "Now that we have established the knowledge and skills required to build out Tableau visualizations using one table from the Superstore Sales data set we can discuss adding nuance and complexity to your data story by including additional tables in our worksheets and visualizations. This is accomplished by customizing our Tableau __data source__. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Tableau, a data source is the bridge between Tableau and the underlying source data. Data sources can be from a single database or file and contain the connection information, meta data, and sheet/table/column names, as well as the relationships between them. Data sources can also be from disparate resources, like two different remote databases in which case Tableau would store and display the connection information, meta data, and sheet/table/column names for both databases in the Data Source. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will discuss what questions you should consider when planning a data source. Then, we will demonstrate the steps necessary to build a custom data source in Tableau. Along the way, we will learn more about essential components in the Tableau environment. \n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Identify and discuss considerations for planning a Tableau data source\n",
    "* Create a custom data source from different tables in the same data set\n",
    "* Generate a sheet and visualization from your custom data source\n",
    "* Save and Publish to Tableau Public"

    "### Planning a Data Source\n",
    "When planning a data source in Tableau, there are six essential considerations that should factor into your plan. Having a clear answer for each of the question groups below will set you up for success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Where is my data located?\n",
    "These questions as you to think about __Data Location and Access__ and how this can impact how you manage your resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the data on premises or in the cloud?\n",
    "> If your data is local do you want to embed it in the workbook?\n",
    "> If your data is in the cloud, do you have the necessary subscriptions and access permissions for all users?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are there any other limitations to locating the data?\n",
    "> If you are using a legacy system, you might want to make sure that drivers and connectors are available for your system.\n",
    "> Is the file type or connection source supported by Tableau?\n",
    "> Are the data usage agreements being negotiated?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are there any other limitations to locating the data?\n",
    "> Are there any other anticipated obstacles to accessing this data, like problems with use agreements?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What shape is the data and how clean is it?\n",
    "These questions ask you to think about __Data Quality__ and how it can be managed and improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do I need to transform the data before it can be used?\n",
    "> If you have wide format data, you may want to consider transforming it to long before building a relationship with that data.\n",
    "> You can also use __Swap__ in the __Command bar__ of your workspace to do this transformation!\n",
    "2. Do I need a pipeline or a way to clean the data before connecting different data sources? Can I do any of these transformations natively in Tableau?\n",
    "> Sometimes, you may want to perform certain transformations or exclude data before connecting to another data set to improve the success of unions or joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. How can the data be combined?\n",
    "These questions ask you to think about your __Data Model__ or the structure of the links between your data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is my data spread across multiple systems? If so, what kind of links can I create?\n",
    "> For example, if you are working with two remote government databases from two separate agencies that both contain name and address data for individuals, you can create a relationship between those data sets using name and address fields the link?\n",
    "2. Are there any existing links between my sources?\n",
    "> Imagine that you are connected to two different workbooks -- __Customer Accounts__ and __Customer Past Due Accounts__. It is likely, that __Customer Past Due Accounts__ was generated by filtering __Customer Accounts__ -- which means that links between them already exist -- the Customer and their balance due. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Why does the user need the data?\n",
    "These questions ask you to think about your __User Experience__ and if you data source is improving or hindering the users' success. \n",
    "1. Are the table and column names understandable?\n",
    "> You can make the data source more friendly for your end user by customizing table and column names for your use case when they are non existent or not informative.\n",
    "2. Does the organization of the data make sense for my use case? \n",
    "> We can improve the usability of this data by removing irrelevant columns and merging relevant columns into better curated tables.\n",
    "3. Is the meta data informative?\n",
    "> If not, you might consider making it more robust to improve how informative your data source is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Who should be accessing the data source?\n",
    "These questions ask you to think about __Scalability, Security, and Discoverability__ and how you can manage these three interests.\n",
    "1. How many people need to access the data source? (Scalability)\n",
    "> If you expect that the data source will have a high volume of requests from users, it is important to find out if your underlying data resources can meet those demands.\n",
    "> If you are unsure of the demands on your data source during production, do you have a plan to scale?\n",
    "2. Do all of my users have the necessary access permissions for the underlying resources? (Security)\n",
    "> How secure are the underlying resources? Will my data source undermine the security of these resources?\n",
    "> Do my end users have permission to access the underlying data source? Is it possible for them to get permission?\n",
    "3. How will users find the data source? (Discoverability)\n",
    "> What will be the point of access for users? Can the people who need to find the data source find it easily?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. When will my data be used and refreshed?\n",
    "These questions ask you to think about __Data Freshness and Resource Performance__ and how these will impact the quality of your data source.\n",
    "1. Should the data be a live connection or an extract?\n",
    "> If you want to stream data that will automatically refresh at the same time as the underlying data resource, go with a live connection. \n",
    "> If that is not possible or if you prefer a static data source, consider how often it should be refreshed and who will refresh it.\n",
    "2. How will we manage multiple connections if our data resources update at different times?\n",
    "> Consider how to coordinate conflicting or asynchronous data resources.\n",
    "3. How often will users access the data source?\n",
    "> Do we have the resources to meet the demands of the users?"
